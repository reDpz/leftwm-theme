# Install instructions

*this is a fork of "basic_polybar"*

To install copy the file to `~/.config/leftwm/themes/`

Then create a symlink, symlink the `leftwm-theme` folder to `current`

Or if you dont care then just rename the folder to `current`.

Theme should work with multiple monitors, remember that the appearance of the tags is configured via `template.liquid` and `sizes.liquid` not polybar.
